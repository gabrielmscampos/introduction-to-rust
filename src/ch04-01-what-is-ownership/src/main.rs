    // There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our String needs to the allocator:
    // when s goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us.
    // This function is called drop, and itâ€™s where the author of String can put the code to return the memory.
    // Rust calls drop automatically at the closing curly bracket.

    // Variables and Data Interacting with Move
    // .......................................
    // bind the value 5 to x; then make a copy of the value in x and bind it to y
    // This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known,
    // fixed size, and these two 5 values are pushed onto the stack.
    let x = 5;

    // When we assign s1 to s2 all data from s1 is copied to s2
    // i.e. a string is made up of [pointer, length, capacity]
    // so s2 and s1 points to the same memory address in the heap
    // the data the pointer is referencing is not duplicated
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    // Going out of the scope would be a problem because
    // both s1 and s2 would try to free the same memory (double free error)
    // what Rust do to ensure memory safety is considering s1 no longer valid
    // after `let s2 = s1`, i.e. Rust doesn't need to free anything when s1 goes out of scope
    // This is similar to shallow copy vs deep copy, but since rust invalidates the first variable
    // instead of begin called shallow copy, it's know as a *move*

    // Adding the following line will give an error, because s1 is not longer
    // valid and to use that variable we could create s2 cloning s1 instead of assigning
    // println!("{}, world!", s1);
    println!("{}, world!", s2);

    // Variables and Data Interacting with Clone
    // ........................................
    // For creating a deep copy (i.e. copying the data in the heap and creating a new pointer) we can use clone:
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();
    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
